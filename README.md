this is a simple iOS adaptation of [UC2000Keyboard for Android](https://github.com/azya52/seiko/tree/master),  it is barely usable due to the frequent transmissions errors.
It is very useful just to change the watch's contrast

"works" with:

- seiko data 2000
- seiko uc 2000
- seiko uc 3000
- seiko spacetronic

the application should be plug and play as there are no external dependencies
